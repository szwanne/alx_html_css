In this project, I was tasked with building a web page from scratch without using any external libraries. The goal was to apply all previously learned concepts of HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design to create a fully functional and visually accurate replica of the provided design.

There were minimal implementation instructions, allowing for creative freedom in how the code was structuredâ€”as long as the final result closely matches the original design.

The design was created by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer.
